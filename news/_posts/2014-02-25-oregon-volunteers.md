When considering where to begin with partnership building, I like to seek out the people I admire most. I sat down with a friend and mentor, Kathleen Joy, Executive Director of Oregon Volunteers.

Oregon Volunteers is the Oregon Commission for Voluntary Action & Service. Their mission is to strengthen our communities by inspiring Oregonians to actively engage, volunteer, and serve.

It goes without saying that Kathleen was very interested in Code for Portland, given that her life work centers around civic engagement. She had a million great ideas and tips for who to talk to on our way towards building partnerships and finding projects to benefit our community!
