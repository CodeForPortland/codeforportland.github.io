We had lots of guests presenting on projects last night!

## PDX Shelter

Fresh from their victory at [Portland Startup Weekend](http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/blog/2014/11/startup-weekend-portland-how-an-app-that-helps-the.html), the folks behind [PDX Shelter](https://pdxshelters.firebaseapp.com/) came by and presented on their project. They shared the surprising statistic that "70% of homeless youth have access to smartphones". The project hopes to enable the homeless to find nearby shelter bed openings more easily.

## Open Trail Data

[Ryan](https://twitter.com/ryanbranciforte) and [Jereme](https://twitter.com/jerememonteau) talked about the work they've been doing with the [Intertwine](http://theintertwine.org/) in relation to the OpenTrails spec. A lot of good things came out of the [Trail Editor](http://www.traileditor.org/) project they started with [Dale](https://twitter.com/hollocherdale) and a couple of other volunteers at the National Day of Civic Hacking event we had back in June, including a lasting partnership with [Oregon Metro](http://www.oregonmetro.gov/). Their work has evolved into [OuterSpatial](http://www.outerspatial.com/), an OpenTrails platform to help agencies from all over the country publish trail data using the new spec developed with help from [Alan Williams](alanjosephwilli) of Code for America. They also showed off OuterSpatial's [Developer Hub](http://dev.outerspatial.com/) which documents the API has loads of goodies.

## OSM Portland Building Imports

[Mele](https://twitter.com/pdxmele) and [Rafa](https://twitter.com/geografa) talked about the [OSM hackathon](http://calagator.org/events/1250467355) last Saturday and continued their work to get a letter drafted to the OSM imports committee to make sure the import process runs smoothly.

## Fully Fund Oregon Schools

[Alex](https://twitter.com/alexlinsker) from [Collective Agency](http://collectiveagency.co/) continued his research into the financial specifics necessary to fully fund Pre-K-12 education and end Oregon income taxes by taxing assets over $1.8 million with help with some volunteers.
