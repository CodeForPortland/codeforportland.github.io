This Tuesday marks our second Hack Night as a Code for America brigade, and we're hitting the ground running! The second [National Day of Civic Hacking](http://hackforchange.org/) is happening at the end of the month, and Portland has no less than [two events](http://hackforchange.org/events?s=portland&event-type=0) in the works to celebrate the occasion.

### Hacking Urban Development <small>with [Intel](https://software.intel.com/en-us/codeforgood)</small>

[The first event](http://hackforpdx.org/) is being put together by Intel and Zidell Yards as part of Intel's [Code for Good](https://software.intel.com/en-us/codeforgood) program, and will be focusing on community-driven urban planning and development of the growing Southwest waterfront district. They are running a two day hackathon and offering awards to the best project in each of the event's categories.

### Building Lasting Services <small>with [Code for Portland](http://codeforportland.org)</small>

[The second event](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Portland/events/183102122/) (our event) is being put together by Code for Portland with sponsorship from Esri, Fine Design Group, Epicodus and North, and is focusing on using technology and open data to build useful and sustainable services for the city of Portland and the state of Oregon. We're planning on having a full day of hacking on Saturday and presentations on Sunday at [North](http://north.com/), and an after party over at [Zidell Yards](http://zidell.com/the-yards/) on Sunday afternoon to connect with the folks from the other event and trade stories.

In the spirit of collaboration, the two hackathons are having a kickoff party together on Friday, May 30th at [Epicodus](http://www.epicodus.com/). There will be beer and food! Minors are also welcome.

We're inviting people to come to [tomorrow's Hack Night](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Portland/events/182017672/) to hear some guest speakers who will be talking about project ideas ranging from civic engagement and voter education to environmental impact of local businesses to being a pilot city for an open trail data specification. We're also encouraging people to propose their own ideas. After that we'll be breaking into groups based on interest in the different projects and planning what to work on during the hackathon at the end of the month.

### Thinking Beyond Hackathons

We've also been working on identifying and inviting organizations and projects that have the potential to grow beyond hackathon projects into long-term successes with a measurable positive impact on the city.

We think Portland is the perfect city to lead the effort to build distributed, community-maintained open source systems on top of open data and be a leader in the world of civic hacking. We've already done a lot of trailblazing in this area, but there's always more work to do and more people to help.

We're hoping you're as excited as we are to build good things that last and to see what we can do to make our city even more awesome than it already is.

Come to tomorrow's hack night! Help us plan, pitch an idea, join a project!
