title: "Tales from the Frontier of Civic Hacking"
---

[Jason Denizac](https://twitter.com/_jden) from Code for America is in town and has offered to stop by and tell us about some of his experiences as a Code for America fellow working with the city of Chattanooga in Tennessee. The [slides from his talk](http://jden.us/cfp-frontier) are available.

## Additional Notes

- End of May - national day of hacking. Community projects will come in and will look to partner up with programmers.
- Environmental Services nonprofit, that is looking to track environmental/waste data.
- open data has a supremely vital role: give more people access to the primary source information.
- civic user testing group_ a chicago-based initiative about, sort of, crowdsourcing QA work and paying people to do it - broadening the base of user testing. "If it doesn't work for you, it doesn't work."
