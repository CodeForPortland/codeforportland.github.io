It took some time and organizing, but we finally had our first Code for Portland hack night!  We gathered to hear some group updates and then broke out into small groups to work on or talk about upcoming project opportunities.

Donâ€™t worry if you missed it, we meet every month. You can [find out when our next meeting is](http://www.meetup.com/Code-for-Portland/).

##### Civic Heroes of all types welcome!

Code for Portland meetups are for coders and non-coders alike. As long as you're interested in making government more open and building interesting things for our city, you're more than welcome!

If you have something you'd like to work on or are excited about for the social and civic good, let us know via the meetup or at the hack night itself.  We are growing our initiative and the energy comes from the community.
