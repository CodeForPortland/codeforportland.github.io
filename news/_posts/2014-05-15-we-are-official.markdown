As of this week, we are an Official Brigade of Code for America!

We met with Preston Rhea, Brigade Program Coordinator for Code for America who reviewed our strategic plan and talked with us about next steps towards becoming an official brigade of Code for America.

Shortly after this meeting, we got word that our <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fNI-5CAT4yVOrLkaQGX_zN94fcWcb4f87sBl4OLiEe0/edit?usp=sharing">strategic plan</a> has been approved and we have been made an official Brigade!
