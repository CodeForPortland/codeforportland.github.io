City Club of Portland is all about bringing together civic-minded people to make Portland a better place to live, work and play, for everyone. We met with Matt Keenen, the chair for City Club of Portland’s Member-Led forum/committee on Transportation, Technology & Access.

Nate Whitstock and I chatted about ways we might be able to partner and have been working with Matt and with City Club ever since. Although we haven’t found a tech project to collaborate on, we have lots in common and they are a great partner to have in building civic engagement.
