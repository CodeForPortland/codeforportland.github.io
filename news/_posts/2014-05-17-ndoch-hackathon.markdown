The National Day of Civic Hacking is a nationwide event to build innovative civic projects planned in coordination with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and will be supported by a number of federal, state and local agencies.

Portland is hosting two Civic Hack-a-thons in celebration of this national day. Join us for a joint kick-off event to celebrate, get inspired, and hear more about each hack-a-thon. There’s all kinds of dreaming, creating, and hacking you can be part of!
